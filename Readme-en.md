# OwnDroid

[简体中文](Readme.md)

### Description

Use Device admin and Device owner privilege to take full control of your device. 

This app is renamed to "OwnDroid" from "Android Owner".

### Docs

I'm preparing new docs. For now, you can go to [User guide (Chinese)](Guide.md)

### Advantage

- Open source. Device owner privilege could be more dangerous than root, close-source software's security is not guaranteed. 
- Easy to use. You can use this utility easily. A chinese [User guide](Guide.md) is also provided. 
- Modern. This app is built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, designed with Material Design 3. And some new features on Android 14 is adapted. 
- Maintaining. This project is updating. Any Issue and PR is welcome. 

### Disadvantage

This software may not have as many features as Google's official [TestDPC](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testdpc) 

### Features

- System
- Network
- Work profile
- App manage
- User restrictions
- User manage
- Password and keyguard
